# Active Context

## Current Work
- Developing CRUD APIs for user management
- Updating Memory Bank documentation to reflect recent changes

## Recent Changes
- Created productContext.md with initial project overview
- Created API routes for user management:
  - src/app/api/users/route.ts for creating and listing users (POST, GET)
  - src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts for operations on specific users (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- Corrected database import in user API routes to resolve TypeScript errors

## Next Steps
- Verify functionality of user CRUD APIs through testing
- Update progress.md to include user API development as a completed component
- Await user feedback or additional requirements for further development
